# About MCPT
Mackenzie Computer Programming Team, affectionately known as MCPT, is a group of dedicated individuals focused on furthering their computer science knowledge and competing in programming competitions.  The team consists of 4 branches --- junior, intermediate, advanced, and girls --- with each branch meeting once a week to learn and train.  MCPT students are interested in learning beyond their course material, building their critical thinking skills and being persistent towards improvement.  These students compete in various special events, as well as 5 ranked on-site programming contests each year.  MCPT hopes to open these competitions to other schools for the upcoming cycle.

# Meet the Execs
## Presidents
### Vincent
I remember when I was in grade 9, I found out that my school had a programming team. I immediately made it my goal to one day be one of the team's presidents (mission accomplished!). In grade 10, I was elected by my peers to run Junior CPT, which is when I really started getting involved in the team. In grade 11, I had multiple executive roles and became much more familiar with how the team is run. Now, in grade 12, I have the privilege of leading the Junior branch, running the website, and participating in all parts of CPT.

In CPT, I've met amazing people, including my fellow executives, who are among my closest friends. We all work together to further computer science education at Mackenzie. This year, I'm going to work as hard as I can to make this the best year in the history of CPT at this school.
## Execs
### Eleanor Robson
CPT has helped me learn to think critically and creatively. Through contests and practice problems, I have become a more persistent problem-solver. More than that, CPT has given me the opportunity to socialize with friends and meet fellow programmers.
### Yuan Yang
I have been a part of CPT for 3 years and enjoyed all the events and lessons held by the club. Last year's Girl's Invitational Contest was the best part! CPT is always enriching and challenging, but this year, it has also become more inclusive and fun.
### Andy Pham
In 9th grade I joined CPT for the lessons and joined the house JDCC competitions. I'm amazed by how much I've learned, just being in a room with enthusiastic members and so many ideas and new concepts flying about. I will never forget my introduction to Bogo, Quantum, and Existentialist Sort (treat yourself, go check them out).

I was inspired to share my knowledge of programming, in the branch I know best: Game Development. This year I'm hyped to help as a Junior Branch exec and teach Game Development alongside my friends Derek and Dereck. We canâ€™t wait to meet you.
