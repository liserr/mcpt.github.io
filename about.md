# About MCPT: 
Mackenzie Computer Programming Team, affectionately known as MCPT, is a group of dedicated individuals focused on furthering their computer science knowledge and competing in programming competitions.  The team consists of 4 branches — junior, intermediate, advanced, and girls — with each meeting once a week to learn and train.  MCPT students are interested in learning beyond their course material, building their critical thinking skills and being persistent towards improvement.  These students compete in various special events, as well as 5 ranked on-site programming contests each year.  MCPT hopes to open these competitions to other schools for the upcoming cycle.
