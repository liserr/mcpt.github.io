Mackenzie invites girls from all TDSB high schools to participate in an on-site programming competition geared directly to them!
With two levels of competition and the ability to work in teams of up to 4, this is the perfect opportunity for female high school students to step out of their comfort zones, and get involved in computer science in a fun, competitive, and engaging way.
