# Problem
George, an eight year old boy, is in love with the number 8. Last year his favourite number was seven, and next year it will likely be nine, but right now, it's eight. He is obsessed with eights of all different sizes and he spends hours drawing figure 8 shapes on paper.

However, George only has 8 * 3 hours in a day, so he has asked you to create a program that will draw 8s for him.

---

# Input
Each test case contains one odd integer $$H (5 \leq H \leq 1005)$$, the height of the 8 to be drawn.

# Output
Output an 8 of corresponding height following the specification exemplified by the sample input/output.
