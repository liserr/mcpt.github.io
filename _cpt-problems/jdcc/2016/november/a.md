# Problem
"In mathematics, theorems are named after the second person to discover them, for the first is always Euler."

Leonhard Euler was a brilliant mathematician who made significant advancements in many areas of math and science, and hence has a lot of things named after him. In this problem, you will figure out whether Euler was the first one to discover a theorem.

---

# Input
A test case begins with an integer $$N (1 \leq N \leq 1000)$$. $$N$$ lines follow, each containing a person's name $$S$$ and a year $$Y$$, which means that person $$S$$ discovered the theorem in year $$Y$$. No two people will discover a theorem in the same year.

# Output
Output the name of the first person to discover the theorem.
