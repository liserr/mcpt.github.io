# Problem
It is a well-known fact that every natural number has a unique prime factorization. That is, you can uniquely express each natural number $$N$$ as:

$$N = P_1^{M_1} \times P_2^{M_2} \times \ldots \times P_K^{M_K}$$

Where $$P_1 \leq P_2 \leq \ldots \leq P_K$$ are prime numbers. For example, $$28 = 22 \times 7$$ and $$3645 = 36 \times 5$$.

In general, finding the prime factorization of large numbers is difficult to do (and serves as a basis for many cryptographic systems). However, in some special cases it is easy to find a numberâ€™s prime factorization.

One such case is when a number is a power of a smaller number. Given a number $$N$$, can you figure out the prime factorization of $$N^N$$?
