# Problem
On New Year's Eve, a popular tradition is to have a countdown to midnight. Starting at some number $$N$$, people count down from $$N$$ to $$0$$ and then burst into celebration. Your task is to write a program that simulates this countdown.

---

# Input
The first line of input provides the number of test cases, $$T (1 \leq T \leq 100)$$. $$T$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one integer $$N (1 \leq N \leq 100)$$.

# Output
For each test case, your program should output one line containing the countdown, which consists of $$N+1$$ space-separated integers ending with an exclamation point.

# Sample Input

3
5
{% endhighlight %}


# Sample Output
{% highlight text %}
3 2 1 0!
5 4 3 2 1 0!
{% endhighlight %}
