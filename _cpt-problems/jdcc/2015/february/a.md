# Problem
Sally loves palindromes and has made it her goal to memorize every palindrome in existence. A palindrome is a string that is the same whether it is read forwards or backwards.

For example, the following strings are all palindromes:

``Dad``\\
``Racecar``\\
``A man, a plan, a canal, panama!`` (If we ignore punctuation)

Sally wants to read the dictionary and memorize every palindrome. Help her figure out whether certain words are palindromes.

# Input
The first line of input provides the number of test cases, $$T (1 \leq T \leq 100)$$. $$T$$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one word containing exclusively uppercase letters.

# Output
For each test case, your program should output one line containing ``YAY`` if the word is a palindrome, or ``NAY`` otherwise.
