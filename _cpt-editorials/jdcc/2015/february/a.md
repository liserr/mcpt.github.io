Check if each letter $$i$$ in the range $$0, S/2$$, where $$S$$ is the size of the word, is equal to its corresponding letter ($$S-i-1$$). If it isn't, then break the loop early and print ``NAY`` otherwise print ``YAY`` after searching the whole word.

## Time complexity
$$\mathcal{O}(S)$$, where $$S$$ is the length of the word.
